<h1>Software</h1>

<p>

<hr>

<p>

The latest version of the GoSDC software is 1.09 (13 June 2020). It is included
with this guide, in

<a href="../../Software">this</a>

directory.

<p>

The files in the 'all' directory are for all versions of GoSDC. The files in
the 'mbe' and 'uni' directories are files that are different for the 'MBE' and
'UNI' version of GoSDC, respectively. Combine the files in the 'all' directory
and the relevant other directory as required.

<p>

Place the files where they need to be :

<p>

<ul>

<li>UPSDC

<p>

This file contains the GoSDC software. Copy it to the root directory of a
FAT12/16/32 formatted flash card, insert the card into GoSDC, and issue
'*SDCTool SDCUp' to start the update process. Wait for it to complete. Then
switch off your machine. And on again.

<li>SDCUP

<p>

If the contents of the flash ROM on GoSDC have become corrupted, and you can
therefore no longer issue '*SDCTool SDCUp' to restore them, you will have to
transfer this (BASIC) file to your BBC or Electron, and 'CHAIN' it.

<li>TOOLROM

<p>

If programmed into a PROM, allows access to SDCUP via the ROM filing system.

<li>storage_struct and osword_b0

<p>

These are text files. Put and read them where you want.

<li>GoSDCio.exe

<p>

This belongs on a PC running Windows 7 or later. Please note that, to run
GoSDCio.exe, you may need to install Microsoft's 'Visual C++ Redistributable
for Visual Studio 2017'.

<li>GoSDCio.unx

<p>

This belongs on a PC running x86 Linux. You may want to rename it to 'gosdcio'
once it is there.

<li>GoSDCio.mac

<p>

This belongs on an Apple Mac running Mac OS X. You may want to rename it to
'gosdcio' once it is there.

<li>Updates

<p>

This is a text file. Read it to know what changed since the last version of the
software.

</ul>

<p>

Refer to the

<a href="../Use/use.html">Use</a>

section of this manual for <i>all</i> additional information, including how to
use this software (and the files in the 'ROMs' directory).

<p>

To update your GoSDC software, see the description of 'UPSDC'.
