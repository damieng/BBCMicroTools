GoXXCio history

0.10
----

- First (beta) release.

0.11
----

- Numerous changes and additions. Still 'beta'.

0.12
----

- Added MMCATO command.
- Added '-f' option.
- First public release.

0.20
----

- Line handling changed :
  - Empty script lines are now ignored.
  - Should now handle all CR/LF combinations.
  - Last script line now read even if not terminated.
- Added 'extract' versions of MMCADxx.
- Added BACKUP and RESTORE commands.

0.25
----

- Added 'delete' and 'rename' type commands.
- Added '-l' option.

0.30
----

- Added NEWDFS and NEWADFS commands.
- Removed RESTORE command, since BACKUP now saves script + objects to a
  directory. This may also be used to discard deleted objects : backup and run
  the script with option '-f'.
- Added MMCAFS command for restoring a backupped (already patched !) filing
  system.
- Bugfix : single objects larger than the cache (was 2MB) now handled
  correctly.
- Bugfix : existence check of tools checked for similar named disc instead.
- Forgot to update MMCATO to not blow up tools to 16K fixed. Now sector-aligns.

0.31
----

- MMCAFS now also knows about FS numbers 81 though 85 (unpatched versions).

0.32
----

- Added '-x' option.

0.33
----

- NEWADFS can now be given two disc sizes e.g. '4M+8M' to create both drives 0
  and 1.

0.34
----

- Added MMCATAP and MMCEXTA commands.

0.35
----

- Added '-s' and '-b' options.

0.40
----

- Removed cause of GCC 4.01 warnings.
- Slight tweaks for Unix compatibility.
- More 'standard, proper, safe, wholesome C++' changes.
- No script is now acceptable (acts like empty script).
- Added '-c' (single command instead of script) option.

0.41
----

- Could not DELFS filing systems other than 1-5 (e.g. 81-85).

0.42
----

- MMCAFS should have known about FS numbers 6,7,86 and 87, does now.
- MMCAFS and DELFS now also know about FS numbers 8 and 88 (GoMMC ROM 1.00).

0.50
----

- Bugfix : argh (!!), objects > 4MB could still become corrupted when added.
  Bad, bad.
- 'Shrink' and 'Blowup' now also work on single-drive ADFS discs (via MMCADAG
  only).

0.51
----

- New filing systems 9 through 11.

0.60
----

- Huge overhaul of the code.
- Bugfix : shrinking an ADFS drive corrupted the root directory's 'parent'
  directory (which is normally the root directory itself, but would become a
  different or invalid directory due to the bug).
- Redesigned commands (see Guide). Summary : 6 main commands left (ADD, NEW,
  DELETE, RENAME, BACKUP, EXTRACT), mostly followed by object type (FS, TOOL,
  MEDIUM (any disc or tape), DFS DISC, ADFS DISC, TAPE), then object name (or
  number for FS), then input/output (file name or disc size(s)). Exceptions :
  no 'ADD MEDIUM', 'NEW' is disc only, no 'RENAME FS'.
- Now compatible with big endian machines (little endian only previously).
- Changed directory creation flags from W to R/W/X for Unix (BACKUP command).
- Support added for HADFS : new filing system number 12 (any version of HADFS)
  and new disc type ('HADFS DISC', all commands except NEW, medium subtype 4).
- Bugfix : CR+LF terminated lines in scripts were counted as two lines (so line
  numbers quoted by errors were wrong).
- 'ADD FS' now recognizes the standard original and patched filing systems, and
  the FS number may now be between 0 and 250. New features : 'ADD FS 0' means
  'auto-detect' (if the filing system is not recognized an error is issued),
  and other FS numbers are faulted if the FS is recognized but is being given
  the wrong number.

0.61
----

- Extracting interlaced floppies was rather slow. Now much faster.

0.70
----

- The size of objects on the MMC, as registered in the catalogue, is now the
  actual, original size (instead of the allocated size).
- Support added for multiple scripts and '-c' commands. They are executed in
  commandline order, and are referred to by number in relevant messages (e.g.
  '2.1' means the first line of the second script or command).
- Support added for setting options inside the script. E.g. 'DO SHRINK' will
  act as the old '-s' commandline option, but can be 'undone' further on in the
  script by e.g. 'DO NOSHRINK'. The '-s' and -b' commandline options have been
  removed. 'DO COMPACT' is a new option, and has the same effect as SHRINK, but
  does not minimize the drive's size (i.e. it is /exactly/ like *Compact).
- All disc processing (deinterlacing, compacting, shrinking, and blowing up)
  can now be combined. If enabled, they are performed in that order.
- Support added for processing multi-drive discs. The disc is split into
  separate drives, which are processed, and is then reconstructed.

0.71
----

- Source now serves GoMMC as well as GoSDC. Whether GoMMCio or GoSDCio is built
  is decided by the makefile (there are now six of them).
- Flash card read/write now uses the 'large file' library calls, to support
  access beyond 4 GiB. Standard compilation for Windows is now via CygWin,
  since DJGPP (being DOS based) does not support 64-bit file addressing.
- For GoSDCio, added command line option '-a' (to select the 'area', see GoSDC
  docs) and removed '-x'.

0.72
----

- The new patched filing systems (for GoMMC 1.16 and GoSDC 1.01) are now
  recognized. The tie that is enforced between them and their standard filing
  system number now works both ways (i.e. just as the recognition implied the
  number, the reverse is now also true).

0.73
----

- Increased maximum number of flash card areas from 4 to 8.

0.74
----

- Bugfix : object name sorting should have been case insensitive. Now it is.

0.75
----

- GoXXCio.exe (compiled under CygWin) was unable to write to the flash card on
  some Windows versions. To fix this, the drive letter is now translated to a
  Unix device path instead of a Windows device path.
- Bugfix : recognizing ROMs failed due to type size mixup.
